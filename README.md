# FishData_ML_Deployment

Here we are building an ML model for the fish market dataset that can be downloaded from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market

I chose to carry out a linear regression analysis that would predict the weight of a specific fish based on the other parameters. 

Using html/css, a frontend webpage was developed which allows for inputs to be provided by the app user, and predictions made.

Flask was the webframework used in building this application.

The model is being hosted on Heroku and can be found here... https://fishdata-ml.herokuapp.com/
